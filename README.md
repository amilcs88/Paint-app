MainActivity class runs the first application that is generated by the onClickListener. inside 
the onCLickListener function random colors are generated when the color button is pressed. These 
color values are stored in variables and displayed on the screen. The draw button is setup as an 
object to create an instance when the draw activity button is pressed to open the drawing panel.
The drawing panel is located in activity2 but is created by the CanvasView class. Activity2 has 
a listener action to return to the main activity if the go back button is pressed. Activity2 also 
had a call to clear the canvas when the button is pressed. The CanvasView contains a startTouch 
method to find the first position, a moveTouch method to track location, a clearCanvas method to 
reset the activity when needed, onTouchEvent method to know if the user is still drawing and OnDraw
method to start the drawing.
